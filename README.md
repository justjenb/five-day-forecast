# five-day-forecast

## Description

Creating this weather app has been an incredibly valuable experience for me as a student to enhance my programming, problem-solving and critical-thinking abilities. Working with APIs to manipulate the data into UI elements is an invaluable skill and used in many web development projects.

The calendar app itself serves as a useful tool to keep track of the weather on a global scale. The tool will recognize a valid city, city, state, and country code, or just city and country code, and return the first result. For more accurate results, search by city, state and country code, or city and country code.

## Installation
